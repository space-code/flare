## Reporting Issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report.

Check that the project issues database doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue. If you find a match, feel free to vote for the issue by adding a reaction. Doing this helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

When reporting issues, please fill out our issue template. The information the template asks for will help us review and fix your issue faster.

## Submitting Pull Requests

You can contribute by fixing bugs or adding new features. For larger code changes, we recommend first discussing your ideas on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/space-code/flare/discussions). When submitting a pull request, please add relevant tests and ensure your changes don't break any existing tests.
